## How to win
Get 21.

## How to lose
go bankrupt.

## A way to keep playing
You can keep playing after every round as long as you aren't out of money.
Each round you can either, win, lose, or tie the dealer.
If you run out of money then it's game over, otherwise, you can continue to play.

## Unique currency
Instead of chips there will be different colored gems!
